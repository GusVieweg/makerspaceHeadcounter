# Makerspace Headcounter
## Aaron Arthur and Augustus Vieweg

This system counts the number of people who have visited the Makerspace and every hour sends that data to an online database where Logistics can use it.  Uses an Intel Galileo board with the Arduino IDE to track data and troubleshoot.

Much of the Arduino C code is largely based on David Mellis' WebClient example in the Ethernet library and Jim Lindblom's phant server system.  The datalogger code comes from a previous project Aaron had worked on and uses the Google Sheets API.
